          <p class="builder-title">Contractor Packages</p>
          <p>
            Builder packages are made for contractors and homeowners who are
            about to start a project. These packages come with three scans:
            Pre-construction, X-ray Scan, and Post-construction. Scans are
            completed in less than an hour and packages are sent back to you
            within 24 hours* after the scan. Each package will come with a 3D
            virtual tour, 25 HD photographs, colour-coded floor plans, and a
            list of all room dimensions and measurements. The first scan will
            come with a DWG file to send to architects, engineers, and designers
            so you can get started with permit applications and design packages
            right away. The DWG file also allows you to work with architects,
            engineers, and designers from all over the world as plans can be
            emailed, and virtual tours can be done together, so communicating
            ideas and discussing things is easy. The 3D virtual tour also allows
            for notes to be left anywhere on the tour. You can click and leave
            anything from text, to an image, to a link. This is useful for
            builders to send to subs for quotes, to familiarize them with the
            project, or to communicate directly with homeowners. Homeowners can
            use this to go over plans with designers as well. The virtual tour
            is a great feature for eliminating travel to jobsites and
            coordinated meetings. Each party can tour the house when they have
            time and leave notes for each other. Another fantastic benefit of
            the virtual tour is the ability to measure on screen. This can be
            used for material orders and quoting, saving people a trip to the
            jobsite to take that one forgotten measurement, or even hanging a TV
            and looking for a stud (with the X-Ray Scan tour). Now some details
            on each scan: 1. Pre-construction: This is the package that will
            include your DWG file, along with a 3D tour, photos, floor plans,
            and dimensions list. It’s great to start a project with everyone
            working from the same plans and this is the perfect way to make that
            happen quickly. 2. X-Ray Scan: This scan is incredibly useful to use
            as a framing, HVAC, plumbing, and electrical map in the future. It
            comes in handy for any warranty work, but also hanging TVs,
            pictures, towel bars, etc. The peace of mind of knowing where all
            water lines are when drilling into walls is a great feature. 3.
            Post-construction: This package is great for use as marketing
            materials for the future. The HD photos and 3D virtual tour can be
            posted to websites or social media so future clients know what they
            can expect from you. For homeowners, it’s great to have a package
            that could be used to list the property in the future. With this
            package you’ll have everything you need to get your listing up
            quickly if you ever decide to sell. There is also a built in feature
            that allows you to connect your plans to FloorPlanner. You can use
            this software to test design ideas on your house before you spend
            any money on your ideas, or spend time dragging furniture around.
            You get accurate 2D and 3D visuals of your space, coloured,
            decorated, and rearranged any way you can imagine. *DWG files can
            take up to 48 hours after the scan to be processed and sent back to
            you.
